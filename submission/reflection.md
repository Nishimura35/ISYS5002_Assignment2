# ✍️ Project Reflection
## AI Tools Used
I used ChatGPT, which helped me to brainstorm the flow chart, sort out the features and deal with many errors and bugs. It was especially helpful when the application did not respond as expected, for example, calling undefined functions and data, not displaying graphs from weather information or using incorrect data types. However, some of the advice was inconsistent as AI did not have access to the entire code.  It also sometimes recommended changing names, which made me to consider the impact on the other parts. It was challenging to decide how to apply the AI suggestions.

## Prompting Techniques
By asking why AI suggested a certain solution, I tried to draw out the deeper insights. I believe this kind of prompting techniques will become more critical and logical.

## What Worked Well?
I am proud that I was able to fix many errors. At first, my code generated a lot errors, but by searching for error messages and asking AI, I was finally able to make the application display graphs. 

## What Would You Do Differently?
I would increase the accuracy of the answers and expand the range of questions the application can handle. I found the application sometimes gave different answers even though the questions are same, and the reproducibility is slightly low. This could be improved by adding more error handling and preparing more question scenarios. Also, enhancing understanding of how fetch-my-weather and hands_on_ai work will help solve these problems.

## Final Thoughts
As I have previously learned the basics of web development, I believe I can now turn some of my ideas into reality using Python. Also, organizing and analysing data can become more efficient with Python.
