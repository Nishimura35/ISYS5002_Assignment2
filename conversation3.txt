Subject: Asking about my-fetch-weather
----------------------------------
Me:
I would like to define def get_weather_data()
Retrieve weather data for a specified location.
Args:
- location (str): City or location name
- forecast_days (int): Number of days to forecast (1-5)
Returns:
- dict: Weather data including current conditions and forecast

The app sends location and 3 days to my-fetch-weather to receives weather data from my-fetch-weather.
The data will be weather, highest temp, lowest temp and precipitation at the end.
Also, the temperature and precipitation will be used to display graphs (this will be defined in the other function).

-------------

AI:
Absolutely! Here's how you could define your get_weather_data() function based on your description, with everything cleanly structured and ready to feed into a graph later:

import fetch_my_weather
import re

def get_weather_data(location: str, forecast_days: int = 3) -> dict:
    """
    Retrieve weather data for a specified location.

    Args:
        location (str): City or location name
        forecast_days (int): Number of days to forecast (1-5)

    Returns:
        dict: Weather data including weather condition, highest temp, lowest temp, and precipitation
    """
    # Cap forecast_days between 1 and 5
    forecast_days = max(1, min(forecast_days, 5))
    view_option = str(forecast_days - 1)  # "0" for 1-day, "4" for 5-day

    raw_text = fetch_my_weather.get_weather(location=location, view_options=view_option, lang="en")

    if isinstance(raw_text, str) and raw_text.startswith("Error:"):
        return {"error": raw_text}

    # Extract high/low temperatures and precipitation
    temp_rain_pattern = r'([+\-]?\d+°C)\s*/\s*([+\-]?\d+°C).*?rain:\s*([\d.]+)mm'
    matches = re.findall(temp_rain_pattern, raw_text)

    # Extract weather conditions (e.g., Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy)
    condition_pattern = r'\n\s*[☀️🌤️🌧️🌩️❄️☁️⛅️]*\s*([A-Z][a-z]+)'
    conditions = re.findall(condition_pattern, raw_text)

    forecast = []
    for i, match in enumerate(matches[:forecast_days]):
        high, low, rain = match
        condition = conditions[i] if i < len(conditions) else "Unknown"
        forecast.append({
            "day": i + 1,
            "condition": condition,
            "high_temp": high,
            "low_temp": low,
            "precipitation_mm": float(rain)
        })

    return {
        "location": location,
        "forecast_days": forecast_days,
        "forecast": forecast
    }

💡 Key Features:
✅ Validates forecast_days to be between 1–5.
✅ Uses fetch_my_weather.get_weather() to retrieve plain-text forecast data.
✅ Uses regex to extract:
	- high and low temperatures (°C)
	- precipitation (rain: x.x mm)
	- weather condition (e.g., Sunny, Cloudy)
✅ Returns a structured dictionary that can easily be passed into a graphing function.

Let me know if you'd like help with the graph part too! 📊

-------------

Me:
I would like to set 3 days as default.
I may code to analyse the user input to check whether it includes days later.

Great idea! You can definitely set the default to 3 days, and later use input analysis to dynamically change the forecast range based on what the user says (e.g. “Give me the weather for the next 5 days”).

-------------

AI:
Here’s an updated version of your function with 3 days as the default, and it’s flexible if you want to pass in a different number of days later:

import fetch_my_weather
import re

def get_weather_data(location: str, forecast_days: int = 3) -> dict:
    """
    Retrieve weather data for a specified location.

    Args:
        location (str): City or location name
        forecast_days (int): Number of days to forecast (1-5)

    Returns:
        dict: Weather data including weather condition, highest temp, lowest temp, and precipitation
    """
    # Make sure forecast_days is within 1 to 5
    forecast_days = max(1, min(forecast_days, 5))
    view_option = str(forecast_days - 1)

    raw_text = fetch_my_weather.get_weather(location=location, view_options=view_option, lang="en")

    if isinstance(raw_text, str) and raw_text.startswith("Error:"):
        return {"error": raw_text}

    # Extract temperatures and precipitation
    temp_rain_pattern = r'([+\-]?\d+°C)\s*/\s*([+\-]?\d+°C).*?rain:\s*([\d.]+)mm'
    matches = re.findall(temp_rain_pattern, raw_text)

    # Extract conditions like "Sunny", "Rainy", etc.
    condition_pattern = r'\n\s*[☀️🌤️🌧️🌩️❄️☁️⛅️]*\s*([A-Z][a-z]+)'
    conditions = re.findall(condition_pattern, raw_text)

    forecast = []
    for i, match in enumerate(matches[:forecast_days]):
        high, low, rain = match
        condition = conditions[i] if i < len(conditions) else "Unknown"
        forecast.append({
            "day": i + 1,
            "condition": condition,
            "high_temp": high,
            "low_temp": low,
            "precipitation_mm": float(rain)
        })

    return {
        "location": location,
        "forecast_days": forecast_days,
        "forecast": forecast
    }


✅ Next Step (Optional):
You mentioned analyzing user input — in the future you could write a small function to detect phrases like:

“3-day forecast”

“weather for the next 5 days”

“tomorrow’s weather”

etc.

That would dynamically set forecast_days. Want help with that part too?

Me:
What is import re?

-------------

AI:
Great question! 🌟

import re is how you import the regular expressions module in Python. The re module lets you search, match, and extract patterns in strings — which is super useful when you're working with messy or complex text like weather reports.

Why use re?
The weather data returned by fetch_my_weather.get_weather() is just plain text (not structured like JSON or a dictionary). So to extract specific pieces like:
- high/low temperature (23°C / 15°C)
- precipitation (rain: 2.5mm)
- conditions (Sunny, Cloudy, etc.)
…you need to find patterns in that text — and regular expressions are perfect for that.

Example
Here’s how re.findall() works in your case:
pattern = r'(\d+°C)\s*/\s*(\d+°C).*?rain:\s*(\d+\.\d+)mm'
matches = re.findall(pattern, raw_text)

This says:
- Find a temperature (like 23°C)
- Followed by /
- Then another temperature (like 15°C)
- Somewhere after that, look for rain: Xmm
And extract all those values into a list of matches.

Summary
| `re` feature   | What it does                                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `re.findall()` | Finds **all occurrences** of a pattern              |
| `re.search()`  | Finds the **first match**                           |
| `re.match()`   | Checks if a string **starts with a match**          |
| `re.sub()`     | **Replaces** parts of a string that match a pattern |

Let me know if you'd like a visual explanation or a beginner-friendly regex practice too — I'd love to help! 😊

Me:
How does this work?
condition_pattern = r'\n\s*[☀️🌤️🌧️🌩️❄️☁️⛅️]*\s*([A-Z][a-z]+)'

-------------

AI:
Awesome question — let’s break down this line so it’s super clear! 💡
condition_pattern = r'\n\s*[☀️🌤️🌧️🌩️❄️☁️⛅️]*\s*([A-Z][a-z]+)'

This is a regular expression pattern (regex) used to extract weather conditions like "Sunny", "Cloudy", "Rainy", etc., from the raw text that fetch_my_weather returns.

🔍 Breakdown of the Pattern
| Part                   | Meaning                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\n`                   | Matches a **newline** character — this usually means we’re starting a new line of the weather report        |
| `\s*`                  | Matches **any whitespace** (like spaces or tabs), zero or more times                                        |
| `[☀️🌤️🌧️🌩️❄️☁️⛅️]*` | Matches any of these **weather icons/emojis**, zero or more times                                           |
| `\s*`                  | Again, match any whitespace after the icon                                                                  |
| `([A-Z][a-z]+)`        | This is a **capture group** that grabs a word starting with a capital letter (like `Sunny`, `Cloudy`, etc.) |

🧠 What It's Trying to Match
An example line from the weather text might look like this:
🌧️ Rain  20°C / 14°C  rain: 3.5mm

The pattern will match:
- Newline before 🌧️
- Skip over the emoji and whitespace
- Capture Rain — because it matches ([A-Z][a-z]+)

🎯 The Final Goal
It’s trying to extract descriptive words for weather conditions that often follow emojis. The result will be a list like:
['Rain', 'Sunny', 'Cloudy']

Each of those will be used as the "condition" in your forecast dictionary.
