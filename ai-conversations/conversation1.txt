Me:
I made the flowchart for my Weatherwise app.
Can you advise me any points I can improve?

Start
↓
Display: "I'm Weatherwise App! Ask me anything about weather."
↓
User input
↓
Check: whether the user input has location
↓ Yes
Store the location data in location
↓ No
Ask "Which city of weather do you want to know?"
↓
Check: whether the user input has date
↓ Yes
Store the date in date
↓ No
Store today's date in date (default)
↓
Get weather information from location and date by using fetch-my-weather
↓
Store weather, max_temp, min_temp, precipitation
↓
Generate graphs with max_temp, min_temp and precipitation
↓
Output weather data
Display: "What else do you want to ask?"

AI:
Nice work, Marina! Your flowchart is clear and logical, and it does a great job guiding the user through the app. Here are a few suggestions to enhance it, especially for usability and robustness:

✅ What’s Great
- Clear user interaction steps (input → check → respond).
- Fallback handling for missing location or date.
- Logical use of default values.
- Good feedback loop at the end ("What else do you want to ask?").

🔧 Improvement Suggestions
1. Error Handling Step
- Where to add: After user input and API call.
- Why: In case the input is invalid or the API fails (e.g., location not found).
- How:
↓  
Check: Is location and date valid in API response?  
↓ Yes  
Continue  
↓ No  
Display: "Sorry, I couldn't find the weather for that. Try again!"  

2. Input Normalization Step
- Where to add: Before checking for location and date.
- Why: It’s helpful to standardize input for case sensitivity, punctuation, or multiple formats.
- Example: Convert "Tokyo on June 5" to {location: Tokyo, date: June 5}

3. User Confirmation Step
- Optional: Confirm detected location and date with the user before fetching data.
- Why: Avoid errors due to misinterpretation.
- How:
↓  
Confirm: "You asked about [location] on [date], right?"  
↓ Yes → proceed  
↓ No → go back to input

4. Graph Display Clarification
- Instead of “Generate graphs,” you might want to specify:
	- Display graphs to the user or
	- Display graph: Max Temp / Min Temp / Precipitation

5. Logging (Optional but good for dev)
- Add: A background process to log queries for analytics or debugging.

✍️ Optional Rewrite of the Ending for Flowchart Clarity
↓  
Display: Weather details and graph  
↓  
Display: "What else do you want to ask?"  
↓  
Loop back to user input  

Let me know if you want this turned into a diagram or if you're adding this to a report—I can help polish the wording too! 😊

Me: 
Thanks, I changed some parts with your advice.

Start
↓
Display: "I'm Weatherwise App! Ask me anything about weather."
↓
User input
↓  
Check: Is location and date valid in API response?  through hands_on_ai
→ Yes  → continue  
→ No → display: "Sorry, I couldn't find the weather for that. Try again!"  
↓
Check: Does the user input have location?
→ Yes → store the location data in location
→ No → ask "Which city of weather do you want to know?"
↓
Check: Does the user input have date?
→ Yes → store the date in date
→ No → store today's date in date (default)
↓
Confirm: "You asked about [location] on [date], right?"  
→ Yes → proceed  
→ No → go back to input
↓
Get weather information from location and date by using fetch-my-weather
↓
Store weather, max_temp, min_temp, precipitation
↓
Display: Weather details and graph with max_temp, min_temp and precipitation
Display: "What else do you want to ask?"
↓
Loop back to user input

AI:
This updated version looks great, Marina! 🎉 It's much more user-friendly and robust now. Here's a quick review with a few final fine-tuning tips to make it even more polished—especially for presentation or submission purposes:

✅ What You’ve Improved (Nice Work!)
- You added input validation using hands_on_ai before anything else—excellent choice!
- The confirmation step is now included, which makes your app feel more interactive and human-like.
- You clarified that graphs are displayed (not just generated).
- The flow loops back for continuous interaction—perfect for chatbot-style UX.

🛠️ Final Suggestions for Refinement
1. Order of Location/Date Checks vs. API Validation
Right now, you're validating location and date before extracting them from the input, which may cause confusion. Here’s a recommended order:
User input  
↓  
Check: Does the user input have location?  
→ Yes → store in location  
→ No → ask "Which city of weather do you want to know?"  
↓  
Check: Does the user input have date?  
→ Yes → store in date  
→ No → store today’s date (default)  
↓  
Confirm: "You asked about [location] on [date], right?"  
→ Yes → proceed  
→ No → go back to input  
↓  
Call hands_on_ai API to validate location and date  
→ Valid?  
   → Yes → continue  
   → No → display: "Sorry, I couldn't find the weather for that. Try again!"  
- Why? You need to know what to validate before validating it.

2. Clarify API Use
If hands_on_ai is used only for validation, and fetch-my-weather is used to retrieve data, make this distinction clearer.
You might say:
- hands_on_ai: Validates and extracts location/date
- fetch-my-weather: Gets actual weather info

3. Minor Wording Polishes (Optional)
Here’s a slightly cleaner version for display text:
Original: “Which city of weather do you want to know?”
💡 Suggestion: "Which city's weather would you like to know?"
Original: “What else do you want to ask?”
💡 Suggestion: "Would you like to ask about another weather forecast?" (More natural)

-------------

Me:
Yes, I'd like to use hands_on_ai for validates and extracts location/date
Also, can you changed the words as advised in wording polishes?

Perfect, Marina！✨
Based on your update and requests, here’s your refined flowchart in clear, submission-ready English, with improved order, polished wording, and clarification on how hands_on_ai and fetch-my-weather are used:
🌦️ Weatherwise App Flowchart
Start
↓
Display:
"I'm Weatherwise App! Ask me anything about the weather."

	"Sorry, I couldn't find the weather for that. Try again!"
	→ Loop back to user input
↓
If location is missing →
Ask:
"Which city's weather would you like to know?"
→ Store response in location
↓
If date is missing →
→ Store today’s date in date (default)
↓
Confirm:
"You asked about [location] on [date], right?"
→ ✅ Yes → proceed
→ ❌ No → loop back to user input
↓
Call fetch-my-weather to get weather information using location and date
↓
Store: weather, max_temp, min_temp, precipitation
↓
Display:
- Weather details
- Graphs with max temperature, min temperature, and precipitation
