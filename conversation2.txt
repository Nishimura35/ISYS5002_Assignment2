Subject: Error handling
----------------------------------
Me:
Here's a coding that an app asks location and provides weather information:
location = input("Hi I'm Weatherwise App!\nI can help you check the weather forecast.\nWhich city are you interested in? (type 'exit' to quit)\n")
weather_data = get_weather_data(location)
create_temperature_visualisation(weather_data)
create_precipitation_visualisation(weather_data)

I would like to make some error handling
- When weather data is not found
- When the user wants to exit
- Any other error
If there are any others I should add, can you advise me?

AI:
Here's a clean, the improved app with proper error handling and some suggestions for extra robustness.

✅ Revised Code with Error Handling
def main():
    print("Hi I'm Weatherwise App!")
    print("I can help you check the weather forecast.")

    while True:
        try:
            location = input("Which city are you interested in? (type 'exit' to quit)\n").strip()
            if location.lower() == 'exit':
                print("Goodbye! Stay weather-wise! ☀️")
                break

            if not location:
                print("Please enter a city name.")
                continue

            weather_data = get_weather_data(location)
            if not weather_data or 'error' in weather_data:
                print(f"Sorry, I couldn't find weather data for '{location}'. Please try another city.")
                continue

            create_temperature_visualisation(weather_data)
            create_precipitation_visualisation(weather_data)

        except ConnectionError:
            print("It looks like there's a problem with your internet connection. Please check and try again.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Oops! Something went wrong: {e}")
            print("Please try again or contact support if the issue persists.")


🧠 Key Error-Handling Features:
City Not Found:

If the city doesn’t return valid data, the app lets the user know and asks for a different input.

User Exit:

Gracefully ends the app when the user types 'exit'.

Empty Input:

Asks the user to enter something if the input is blank.

Connection Issues:

Handles internet-related errors specifically (if get_weather_data uses network calls).

Unexpected Errors:

Catches all other exceptions to avoid crashing and gives user-friendly feedback.

🔍 Bonus Recommendations:
Log errors to a file for debugging purposes.

Add retry logic if an API call fails temporarily.

Support fuzzy matching or suggest alternatives if city names are misspelled.

Use a default location (e.g., user’s IP-based city) if nothing is entered.

I was thinking of main in the script, but should I define main() and call this function later?

-------------

AI:
Great question — yes, defining a main() function and calling it at the end of your script is a best practice in Python. It makes your code more organized, reusable, and easier to manage, especially as your program grows.

✅ Why define and call main()?
1. Cleaner structure – separates logic from execution.
2. Easier testing – you can import the script in another module without running the app immediately.
3. Python standard – it follows the common Python pattern.

🧩 How to do it properly
Here’s how you can define and call the main() function in a script:
def main():
    print("Hi I'm Weatherwise App!")
    # rest of your weather app logic here...

# This ensures the script only runs when executed directly
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

🔐 What does if __name__ == '__main__': mean?
When you run your script directly (e.g., python weather_app.py), the __name__ variable is set to '__main__', so main() runs.

But if you import this script into another one (e.g., for testing or extension), main() won’t run automatically — which is what you want.

TL;DR:
✅ Yes, wrap your logic in a main() function
✅ Call it using if __name__ == '__main__':
🚀 This keeps your code clean, professional, and scalable
